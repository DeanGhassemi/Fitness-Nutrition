# Progressive Overload

Progressive Overload is an application that makes it easy for bodybuilders track their progressive overload and making it easier to realize when an exercise needs to be swapped out as they are no longer progressing on it.

# Description

This is a web application that has features for tracking workouts. You can add new workouts to your workout program to fit whatever periodization you are following currently. Some features include editing workout plans (adding, editing, removing, updating workouts), weight and reps for progressive overload, and notes for each workout. This program can be used to develop your own front-end and back-end muscles!

This application is made using MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack. I have chosen this stack for specific reasons related to my application. React is a very UI component based framework and makes it easier for state management. As for the backend, Node and Express are used. Node was chosen for its server sided development and how easy it makes building fast and scalable. Now for Express, it strives with API related tasks. I used express to develop my RESTful API and it works great with node! For my database, I went with MongoDB as workout details do not contain any relationship. It is completely fine to have duplicate data as people have different ways of training and programming their workouts.

I am following a tutorial playlist by NetNinja. Not everything done in my version has been covered in the tutorial playlist as his version isn't exactly what I want to develop. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BzS5Oz5E4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE
