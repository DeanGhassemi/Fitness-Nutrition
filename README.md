# Fitness'Nutrition
A platform created to aid myself in tracking my needs for nutrition and fitness.

# Description
This is a web application that has features for tracking workouts and nutrition. You can add new workouts to your workout program to fit whatever periodization you are following currently. Some features include editing workout plans (adding, editing, removing, updating workouts), weight and reps for progressive overload, and notes for each workout. This program can be used to develop your own front-end and back-end muscles!

This application is made using MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack. The technologies used weren't chosen specifically for the application. I am new to web development and wanted to explore back-end development and frameworks. I used this stack to get familiar with backend, api's and reactjs. I am also using an application called Postman to test my API and backend development.

# Credits
I am following a tutorial playlist by NetNinja. Not everything done in my version has been covered in the tutorial playlist as his version isn't exactly what I want to develop. Credits to him for a lot of the programming and idea https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BzS5Oz5E4&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE
